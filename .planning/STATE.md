## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Separate repos per worker type (different build deps, release cycles)
- Audio workers first (TTS/STT/voice cloning before image gen or embeddings)
- Chatterbox recommended as primary voice cloning engine (MIT license, commercial-safe)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2: pyannote-audio requires HF_TOKEN for speaker diarization (gated model). Must degrade gracefully when absent.
- Phase 4: GPT-SoVITS CUDA 12.4 compatibility unverified. Chatterbox is confirmed primary engine; GPT-SoVITS deferred to v1.x if needed.
- Phase 4: Chatterbox multilingual claim (23 languages) is unverified. Validate before advertising cross-lingual as a feature.
